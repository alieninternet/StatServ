 Statistics Help                                          

 This service collects data from users regarding which
 IRC client they are connect to IRC with. This data is
 being collected in order to improve the quality of your
 service, and improve the help we can provide. Your
 privacy is important, so we only collect the version of
 your IRC client software, and nothing else. 

 Should you wish to not be a part of this analysis, you
 may opt out by typing /msg Statistics ignore -
 This will stop your current nickname from being checked
 the next time you connect. 

 If you are being ignored and wish to become a part of
 the statistics collection again, you may opt in by
 typing /msg Statistics unignore - Your IRC client
 will be checked the next time you connect.

 Should you have any questions regarding this service,
 please e-mail pickle@austnet.org
